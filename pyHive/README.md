### README
# Files
1. query.py
2. config.py

# Steps
1. Change your credentials in config.py (just your username and table name)
2. The function runQuery(cursor,query) in query.py takes 2 params. The first is the cursor, which is preset. You just need to pass the query in this function. It will return the results in an iterable.

### NOTE : keep config.py and query.py together in a folder
