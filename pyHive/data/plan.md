1. 10th Dec. ==> Complete graph generation 
2. Animation through tableau --> I will look into it [*** Severity change for each city (districts) yearly -- heatmap ***]
4. prepare the presentation and slides

Graphs:
a. 1st is category wise graph (histogram) for each city combined in one dataset [# histogram]
b. Each city heatmap graph for Crime Index : 10 --> 1 for each year [small graphs , put in one slide] => total of 3 slides, one for each city

--- If we have time ---
===========================
# hourly change of crime Index for given time range
--> for any given range, get the query results for crime index for each time bucket and then stitch to animation
